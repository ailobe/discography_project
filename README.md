# Discography project Task

## Description

You have been asked to implement a simple website to manage the database of Musical records from a discography firm.

For the complete instructions, check the pdf [Discography project Task](https://github.com/ailobe/discography_project/blob/master/Discography%20project%20Task.pdf).

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install
```

Next, migrate and seed the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
$ rails db:seed
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
